# Mapty App

## Overview
The Mapty app is a user-friendly web application designed for outdoor enthusiasts to log their cycling and running workouts. It automatically detects your current location using your IP address and allows you to mark any location on the map to log a workout. Users can specify the type of workout (cycling or running) and the distance covered.

## Features
- **Location Detection**: Automatically detects your current location using your IP address.
- **Interactive Workout Logging**: Users can click anywhere on the map to mark the start of their workout. A detailed sidebar popup allows for the comprehensive logging of workout details.
- **Enhanced Workout Options**: Beyond simply categorizing activities as cycling or running, users can input distance (in km), duration (in minutes), elevation gain (in meters), and cadence (for running), making for a detailed workout log.
- **Distance and Duration Tracking**: Allows for precise input of the distance covered (in km) and the duration of the workout (in minutes).
- **Elevation Gain Tracking**: Records the elevation gain (in meters) during the workout, providing valuable insights into terrain challenges.
- **Cadence Tracking**: For running workouts, users can record their cadence (steps/min), adding another layer of detail to their workout logs.
